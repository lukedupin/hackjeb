Mechjeb 1.9.8 base code update.

Before I start, all credit goes to the MechJeb team who created a wonderful platform for expansion.

I've updated the default mech jeb client to include new features:

VAB
  - Show a price of your ship

Vessel Info
  - Reduce info update rate to 2x per second for better performance
  - Current total thrust.
  - Current thrust to weight ratio.
  - Show current Acceleration delta.
  - Show current change in acceleration delta.
  - Show current distance until Delta V is zero, useful for landing
  - Show current time until Delta V is zero, useful for fuel consumption
  - Show true altitude in vessel info.
  - Engine efficiency, helps tune throttle for best use of fuel.  Larger number is better
  - Fuel flow - current total fuel flow.
  - Time scale.  Provides the ability to slow down game time up to 20x slower.  this is a must for launch large ships.

Planitron
  - Provides a way to set Kerbin to the characteristics of any other celestial body.  This is extremely helpful for testing out remote return crafts, or rovers.
